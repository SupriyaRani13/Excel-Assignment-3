5. What happens if you choose a column, hold down the Alt key and press 
   the letters ocw in quick succession?

Solution: When you perform the Alt + ocw sequence, Excel analyzes the data in the selected column and looks for patterns.
          It then tries to intelligently predict and populate the values in the adjacent cells based on that pattern.
          
     Eg:-If you have a column with full names (e.g., "John Smith," "Jane Doe"), and you perform the Alt + ocw sequence,
         Excel might recognize the   pattern of separating first and last names. It would then automatically fill the adjacent cells with
         the first and last names extracted from the original column.

6. If you right-click on a row reference number and click on Insert, where will 
   the row be added?

          Right-click the selection, and then select Insert Rows.
